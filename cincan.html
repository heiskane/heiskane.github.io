				<h3>CinCan</h3><br><br><br>
				<p>I decided to try setting up CinCan in advance and used a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 for it. Since its a fresh install there is a few things to do first. I started my fixing the display resolution using a few commands seen in the image.</p><br><br><br>

				<img src="img/cin1.png">
				<p>After that i started by doing the usual sudo apt update and upgrade to make sure everything is up to date. I also installed vim and tmux then ran “echo 'set -g default-terminal "screen-256color"' > ~/.tmux.conf” to set tmux to use some nice colors. I installed docker and docker-compose but had to re-install those later. I used "git clone" to clone the repository as instructed. Navigating the environment directory i ran "sudo bash build.sh -e BUILD_PATH=/opt/cincan" but this gave me an error and required apache2-utils. I simply used apt to install those and tried again.</p><br><br><br>

				<img src="img/cin2.png">
				<p>Going into /opt/cincan/build and trying to run the docker compose command it gave another error. After some troubleshooting i figured out that the required version of docker-compose is 1.18.0+ despite the README file saying that version 1.17.1 is required (which i had). I went to the docker-compose github page and chose to use version 1.25.4<br>
				Docker-Compose Versions > <div class="links"><a href="https://github.com/docker/compose/releases" target="_blank">https://github.com/docker/compose/releases</a></div><br>
				I used these commands to install it (after removing the old version using “sudp apt remove docker-compose”).<br>curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-`uname -s`-`uname -m` -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose<br>
				chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose</p><br><br><br>

				<img src="img/cin3.png">
				<img src="img/cin4.png">
				<p>After fixing the issues with docker compose doing the docker compose command gave some error saying that docker is runnung in an unexpected location. I had been trying to fix if earlier so i might have broken something so i just re-installed it by following the steps on dockers site after which the docker compose command ran as expected.</p><br>

				<img src="img/cin6.png">
				<p>Navigating to https://172.20.0.3 i got to the concourse page. Took me a while to figure out the credentials but i eventually looked at the README file properly and found the credentails to log in with.</p><br><br><br>

				<img src="img/cin8.png">
				<p>Actually closing everything down also gave me some error but this is probably enough initial testing for now.</p><br><br><br>
